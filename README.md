# Personal Toolbox

This repo contains things that aren't on a typical Parrot/Kali
install so when I take certificaton tests or need to use 
another device for any reason I can just clone this repo
onto it and I have all the nifty tools I need.

Not all of this code is mine, nor will it be all mine in the 
future. I am doing this because there are pieces of repos all
across github that I like but not everything from everyone is 
useful. 

## Credits

Listed below are the people whose scripts or code I have 
directly added or modified for this repo so nobody gets 
on my ass about 'stealing'.
